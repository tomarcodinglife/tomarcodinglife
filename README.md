Hello! I’m Sujit Tomar, a passionate Software Engineer with a diverse skill set in both coding and design. With expertise in languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript and Python, I build dynamic and efficient applications using frameworks like React, Angular, Node.js, and Express.js. I also have a solid foundation in database management with MongoDB and SQL, and I’m proficient in PHP and C++.

Beyond coding, I enjoy crafting engaging user experiences as a Graphics Designer. I’m skilled in tools like Photoshop, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, and InDesign, allowing me to create visually appealing designs that resonate with users. For video editing, I use Filmora, VN Editor, Adobe Premiere Pro, and After Effects to bring my creative visions to life.

I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn and adapt in this fast-paced tech landscape. Let’s connect and explore opportunities together!
